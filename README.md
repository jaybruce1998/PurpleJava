Welcome to the world of... java! This was programmed entirely by me, and is a love letter to a certain creature-catching game.
The resources folder is missing some obvious subfolders, you'll have to create those yourself (like *I* did) or get them from... someone.
This game supports Dvorak and Qwerty natively. When in doubt, try clicking more (right-clicking cancels out of menus).
If you're a kind soul, please run the jar file through a console so you can find bugs for me (nothing like a good stack trace!)

YOU NEED JDK 25 TO RUN IT! https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk25-windows Either installer should work, don't download the compressed archive!
